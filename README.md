## New: Persistent Notes Feature üìù

**All reconciliation tables** now include a **persistent notes system**:

### How it Works
- **Editable Notes Column**: Add notes directly in any reconciliation table for each booking discrepancy
- **Automatic Persistence**: Notes are saved to separate CSV files for each table type
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Notes persist between app restarts and data reloads
- **Export Integration**: Notes are included in Excel exports
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: All notes are included in the full reconciliation report

### Available in All Tables
1. **Missing Bookings** ‚Üí `missing_bookings_notes.csv`
2. **Cancelled vs Open** ‚Üí `cancelled_vs_open_notes.csv`
3. **Amount Differences** ‚Üí `reconciliation_notes.csv`
4. **Payment/Refund Comparison** ‚Üí `payment_refund_notes.csv`

### Usage
1. Navigate to any reconciliation tab (Missing Bookings, Cancelled vs Open, Amount Differences, or Payment/Refund Comparison)
2. Edit notes directly in the "Notes" column of the table
3. Click **"üíæ Save Notes"** to persist your changes
4. Notes will automatically reload when you restart the app or reload data

### Notes File Structure
Each table type has its own CSV file with the following structure:
```csv
Booking_ID,Notes,Last_Updated
290981542,"Investigated - customer paid twice, refund processed","2024-01-15 10:30:00"
290981543,"Tax calculation error, QB amount is correct","2024-01-15 10:32:00"
```

### Management Features
- **Notes Statistics**: View count of bookings with notes for each table
- **File Information**: See file size, modification date, and total notes count per table
- **Clear All Notes**: Option to clear all notes for each table type (use with caution)
- **Unified Export**: Full reconciliation report includes all notes from all tables
- **Backup**: All CSV files can be manually backed up or version controlled

### Best Practices
- Use concise, actionable notes (max 500 characters)
- Include resolution status (e.g., "Resolved", "Pending", "Investigated")
- Note any actions taken or required follow-up
- Different note files allow for table-specific workflows
- Regular backup of all notes files is recommended
